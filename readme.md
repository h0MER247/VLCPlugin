# VLC Player Plugin
This is a pretty basic NetBeans plugin that can play videos inside the NetBeans IDE. In order to do that the project uses [vlcj]. Tested to work with NetBeans IDE 8.2 and VLC 2.2.6.

### Prerequisites
 - You must have VLC installed.
 - The JRE and VLC must be **both** either 32 or 64 bit.

Have fun.
